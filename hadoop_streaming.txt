Hadoop streaming is a utility that comes with the Hadoop distribution. 


Eg:

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \
    -input myInputDirs \
    -output myOutputDir \
    -mapper /bin/cat \
    -reducer /bin/wc


In the above example, both the mapper and the reducer are executables that read the input from stdin (line by line) 
and emit the output to stdout. The utility will create a Map/Reduce job, submit the job to an appropriate cluster, 
and monitor the progress of the job until it completes.

When an executable is specified for mappers, each mapper task will launch the executable as a separate process when the mapper is initialized. 
As the mapper task runs, it converts its inputs into lines and feed the lines to the stdin of the process. 
In the meantime, the mapper collects the line oriented outputs from the stdout of the process and converts each line into a key/value pair,
 which is collected as the output of the mapper. 
By default, the prefix of a line up to the first tab character is the key and the rest of the line (excluding the tab character) will be the value. 
If there is no tab character in the line, then entire line is considered as key and the value is null.
